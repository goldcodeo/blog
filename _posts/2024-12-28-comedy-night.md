My Saturday = Video games, Virtual reality, Apartment hunting and a Comedy show. 

Writing is difficult. I should write something! It all sounds great, but for some reason is difficult to do. 
I vaguely remember one of my english professors explaining that in order to write you must be able to think. Which is why writing essays is
such a significant part of college education. I think that is one of the reasons I am starting this blog. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Xzrl6Rq9t1c) is one professor saying that

But there is more to writing than just organizing my own thoughts. Writing also empowers me to share ideas with other people, *maybe that is why you are here*

## My Saturday

I slept in very late today -- 12 PM. I start my day the usual way I do, by taking my dog on a walk. Trying to remember my day is actually difficult, 
probably because I haven't been doing that very often. I will use my internet history to retrieve more information about what I did and hopefully that will help me improve my memory. 
For now, I will just use my browser history as an aid.

- 12:00 -> wake up and walk dog
- 12:45 -> order ubereats -> breakfast burrito and pumpkin spice latte
### 1:00
  At this time I went on a youtube tagent. They got me first thing in the afternoon with two cool videos [3D modeling with LLM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytomieYqUCQ) and [3d printing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FHjfzS4BqQ)
  Both of these videos made me excited. I feel like the LLM video may be peak a in to AI workflows of the future. And the 3d modeling video made me excited to think about the different things I could potentially build, and the 
  possiblity of making some profits from that was also interesting. I almost made a purchase for a 3d printer, but I decided I should avoid and impulsive decision and wait a month or two to decide. 
### 1:30 until 8:30 
  This time period was filled with many things. Mostly, surfing the web reading about things such as investments, current events (immigration), the potential robotics / AI future (overwhelming), and apartment hunting online. I always
  have a hard time determining which apartments would be worth considering.. They usually have some bad reviews and I would hate to live in a shitty apartment given how much time I spend at my place. I ended up using a combination of 
  crimemaps website and sorting by google reviews and reading the lowest reviews, eliminating the apartments that had reviews about crimes or infestations. My favorite is when the only bad reviews are about stupid things like rude staff
  or noisey dogs. 

### Comedy Show 
  The highlight of today was the comedy show I went to, I saw the very funny Tim Dillion. The opening comedian was also funny but I do not remember his name . . . . Anyways, comedy shows are fun. I enjoy observing how the comedian
  performs. I'm no expert, but it seems like when comedians start their act they say something self deprecating or they make fun of the city they are in. The first comedian noted how weird it was that there was large section of seating
  in the middle of the room that was empty, and then he made fun of his home town. The headliner made fun of the city which was quite funny. I imagine the comedian arriving in and walking around the city looking for things to joke about
  on stage.

### Now - midnight
  After the show I decided to create this blog and write this first post, I plan to udate this regularly but I am not going to set a firm schedule as of now. It won't always follow the format of this post.

### Tomorrow 
  I am heading out on a road trip tomorrow to look at apartments for a few days. Hopefully I can find a decent one!
